# Online-leave-mangement
 The Student Leave Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing student leave requests in academic institutions. Traditionally, leave applications are handled manually, resulting in time-consuming processes, paperwork, and potential communication gaps between students and faculty. 
 This project aims to eliminate these inefficiencies by providing a digital platform that enables students to submit leave requests online and allows faculty (admins) to view, accept, or reject these requests through a dedicated admin panel.

The system is developed using CSS for the frontend, PHP for backend logic, and MySQL as the database. It supports two main user roles: Students, who can register, log in, and submit leave applications; and Admins (Faculty), who can review and manage these applications. The database contains two key tables: Users and Leaves, which store user credentials and leave-related data respectively.

This solution ensures accuracy, transparency, and ease of use, making leave management more efficient for both students and faculty. It is scalable and adaptable for integration into educational institutions aiming to digitize their administrative processes.
